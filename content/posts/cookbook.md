Hello! I don't have much to share in this post, but I just wanted to announce I've started putting together my own cookbook, readable on my [GitHub Pages site](https://siliconself.github.io/cookbook). If you didn't know, I moonlight as a home cook and people have been asking me to start putting my recipes together somewhere they can follow along for a while now. Hope you all enjoy!
