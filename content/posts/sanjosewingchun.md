## My Trip To San Jose

Something I've noticed throughout my journey in martial arts is that while the more militaristic Japanese style with belts and ranks seems to suit my specific learning style better, the familial "skill family" approach of the Chinese arts seems to produce students with a much deeper understanding of the theoretical side of their arts. That's why while on vacation in San Jose, California this past week, I jumped at the opportunity to meet and learn from Sifu Ben Der, founder of San Jose Wing Chun, who turned 83 years old this week. As one of the preeminent scholars of Leung Sheung lineage Wing Chun, a lineage famous for their attention to detail, if anybody could help me reach greater insights into why martial arts work, it would be him. While just one week with Sifu Ben is obviously nowhere near enough to make any claim to a knowledge of Wing Chun Kung Fu, I still feel like I have come away with some newfound wisdom and new concepts to think about.

This post does not have much in the way of a defined structure, it is mostly just my thoughts about Wing Chun as I go through the week.

## Where Does Wing Chun Live?

Wing Chun hands seem to live where the sagittal plane meets the diaphragm[^1]. Everything else seems focused on reinforcing the sagittal plane. When settling into my horse, a consistent correction that I saw made of myself and others was where the hips are positioned. While it was uncomfortable to maintain that position at first, I noticed that my hips were being moved such that my center of mass was being positioned directly superior to the midpoint between my heels. With the center of mass correctly positioned above the midpoint between the heels, the horse uses tension of the abductor muscles to create counteracting levers preventing lateral motion to either side.

If the position of the opponent changes Wing Chun practitioners will pursue, rotating their sagittal plane to always keep the fight as medial as possible. High, lateral techniques like Fat Sau (拂手) do exist, but they are explicitly not ideal and designed to bring a lateral attack into the sagittal plane. As for the diaphragm, it seems to be where the hands are the strongest.

[^1]: While I originally thought about saying the hands live on the line where the sagittal meets the transverse plane, the transverse plane is typically lower than the diaphragm at the bottom of the ribcage that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.

## What Is Energy?

Sifu Ben regularly refers to putting "energy" into things. While at first I thought this referred to force, it quickly became apparently to me that there's more to it than that. During Siu Nim Tao (小念頭), I was encouraged to have forward energy in my wu sau while bringing it backwards towards my sternum. At time of writing, my current theory is that what Sifu Ben is calling "energy" is a combined concept of muscular tension reinforcing structure, but talking to another student brought up the concept of intention as a part of "energy." I will have to investigate this further.
