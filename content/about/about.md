An enthusiast and hobbyist struggling to find time to wear all of my hats. Here's a few of them:

**ü¶Ä Rust Programmer:**
My time in tech has been a wild ride. I got my start writing HPC code for realtime operating systems in the defense industry, then went into the nonprofit space, then biotech, and most recently television. In the ever-evolving landscape of programming languages, I've found my home in Rust because of its reliability and compile-time safety without compromising on performance.

**üöë Emergency Medical Technician:**
Before I fully broke into the tech industry, I was an Emergency Medical Technician for a short time. While I'm no longer working with the National Registry, I still keep my certifications current and volunteer to help keep people safe at events like concerts, shooting competitions, pride parades, and more.

**üïµÔ∏è Hacker:**
While I may be a blue team programmer by day, after hours I spend a lot of time on security research. I've especially taken interest in:
- Writing bespoke malware finding novel ways to target Windows platforms
- Car hacking with OBD-II reverse-engineering and finding vulnerabilities in infotainment systems
- Using source code static analysis for automated web application vulnerability testing

**üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Boulderer:**
Bouldering is my favorite sport and I try to go at least once a week. I am constantly trying to push my strength and skills to reach higher and higher on the V scale.

**‚ö°Ô∏è Homelab Enthusiast:**
I run my own fleet of servers for personal projects and infrastructure using decommissioned datacenter hardware from eBay running NixOS. Things I host include servers for [Conduit](https://conduit.rs), [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), various game servers, and more.

**ü•ã Martial Artist:**
I am an avid martial artist and pursuing shodan in International Kenpo and Kamishin-Ryu. I've also been interested in the biomechanics of early Hong Kong Wing Chun and have been incorporating some of their theories into my usual arts.

**üåê Digital Privacy Advocate:**
I am a huge proponent of digital privacy and an [EFF](https://eff.org) member. I have developed several tools to help people enforce their own privacy online and work with survivors of stalking, sexual assault, and domestic violence on a pro-bono basis to protect their physical safety by enhancing their digital privacy    .

**üå≤ Explorer:**
Being from Colorado I naturally love all things outdoors and I'm always looking to get outside more. From the Pawnee grasslands to the mountains and national forests you can often find me camping, hiking, rock climbing, skiing, mountain biking, rafting, or something else.

<!-- **Let's Connect:**
I thrive on meaningful conversations. Whether it's delving into the intricacies of Rust, sharing insights into web development trends, or discussing the unique blend of military and tech experiences, I'm always up for a chat. Let's build something great together! -->
